<b><p>The Crewmates can win the game one of two ways; either by completing all assigned tasks or by ejecting all Impostors. Impostors can likewise win in two ways; either by killing or ejecting all Crewmates,[e] or by sabotaging a critical system on the map (provided the Crewmates do not resolve it in time). Games can also end by players quitting the match if doing so fulfills any win condition (if a Crewmate quits the game, their tasks are automatically considered completed).</p>
<p>Among Us is an American science-fiction social deduction game made by Innersloth LLC. The game was inspired by the party game Mafia and the science fiction horror film The Thing. It was released for iOS and Android on June 15, 2018, for PC on Steam on November 16, 2018. It was also released on itch.io on August 17, 2018. Among Us follows a crew being killed one at a time by one or more Impostors. The game got very popular in late 2020 because many Twitch streamers and YouTubers have played it.</p>
<p>In December 2021, Innersloth announced that there would be a virtual reality version of the game, called Among Us VR.</p>
<p>In Among Us, players play as one of four to fifteen players, and can either be a "Crewmate" or an "Impostor". Each game has a minimum of one Impostor, and a maximum of three Impostors in it. The number of Impostors can be changed at the start of the game.</p>
<p>Crewmates are given a list of tasks to complete at the start of the game. They can win if everyone does their tasks, or if they vote out all the Impostors.</p>
<p>Impostors can win by killing all the Crewmates, or killing enough Crewmates so that there are more Impostors than Crewmates. They do not have tasks, but instead can pretend to do tasks. Impostors can pretend to complete these tasks to make it seem like they are not Impostors. Impostors can travel around the map using vents, and "sabotage" parts of the map (such as causing a reactor meltdown on The Skeld) to distract or kill other Crewmates.</p>
<p>Every player has a chance to call an emergency meeting or, when they see a fallen body, to report it to everyone else. During a report meeting, players can talk about who they think is the Impostor. This is the only time when players can talk to each other and vote. If a player gets the most votes, they are voted out, meaning they are kicked out from the game. Among Us does not let players use voice chat. Players can only talk by typing messages. Because of this, many players use services like Discord for voice chat.</p>
<p>When a player is killed by the Impostor, or if they are voted out, they become a ghost. Ghosts can not do things with other players, and they can not talk or vote during meetings. However, they can still do tasks, and see the rest of the game. Ghost Impostors can also sabotage to help their teammates. If both the Crewmates and the ghosts complete their tasks, the Crewmates will win. If the Impostor kills everyone or if the Crewmates run out of time on certain sabotages, the impostor wins. As of the new Update, Crewmates can become Scientists, Engineers, Guardian Angels or the regular Crewmate. The Impostors can become a Shapeshifter or the regular Impostor.</p></b>
