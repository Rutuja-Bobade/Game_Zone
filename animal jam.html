Due to its rapid growth, Animal Jam Classic has spawned different types of merchandise, including figurine toys, books, board games, and a subscription box.</p>
<p>Although Animal Jam Classic is primarily played on PC, the Animal Jam Classic universe has been expanded to incorporate most mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets, and iOS devices. The most popular Animal Jam Classic mobile app spin-off is Animal Jam, previously known as Animal Jam - Play Wild!, which is a 3D version of the Animal Jam Classic world. WildWorks has also developed other apps that are based on the Animal Jam Classic game including Tunnel Town, AJ Jump, and Dash Tag.In May 2020, in an event dubbed the "aMAYzing Migration", WildWorks rebranded the desktop game from Animal Jam to Animal Jam Classic; as part of the event, the app that was formerly known as Animal Jam - Play Wild! was rebranded to Animal Jam.</p>
<p>Animal Jam Classic takes place in an area known as Jamaa, with various different biomes and customizable animals. New players can create an animal with a name that is composed of three simple words. From that point, players can customize and move around with it in the gameplay environment. The original 6 virtual animals that could be created were the Bunny, Monkey, Wolf, Tiger, Panda, and Koala, though many more animals have been added.</p>
<p>Players can customize their own dens (virtual houses) with furniture, chat with other players, adopt pets, play mini-games, purchase in-game clothing and furniture with currency, trade items, attend parties, and go on various RPG-style adventures. There is a subscription-like membership feature available on the site that costs real money and lets players access certain exclusive in-game features.</p>
<p>Animal Jam Classic contains three versions of in-game chat, which offers various levels of restriction. Bubble Chat restricts players from typing messages but will allow them to select predefined words and phrases in a list. Safe Chat, the default setting, allows players to type words or phrases in a particular list which only the game permits, similar to a whitelist. Safe Chat Plus, which was previously available only to members but is now available for all players, allows players to type any word or phrase while being run through the game's safe chat filter. Parents can control playersâ€™ chat settings from the site's parent dashboard. One player can report or block another player for unacceptable, intolerable, or inappropriate behavior. If a player is found chatting in an inappropriate way, the player may have their chat temporarily muted or even be suspended from logging on for a long period.</p></b>
