<b><p>CrossFire is a F2P (free to play) FPS (first-person shooter) in which you can compete online against millions of other players around the world.Players progress and eventually be promoted through various military ranks, beginning at trainee, with the highest being Marshall. Players can also customize their character's equipment and appearance through in-game items.</p>
<p>Crossfire has a free currency which is called "Game Points" (GP), which is earned through playing and completing matches, buying premium items that grant bonus GP, or fulfilling certain missions. Premium and special items like modified weapons can only be bought using monetary currencies. The content tends to vary from version to version.Gameplay in CrossFire is very similar to that in the classic game Counter Strike. This time around, there are two different bands of mercenaries, Black List and Global Risk, head-to-head in a conflict affecting the entire world. You, of course, must align yourself with one or the other.</p>
<p>Like other online shooting games, CrossFire has various different playing modes - more than a dozen in all. Some of the best include classics like Team Deathmatch and Zombie Mode, as well as new favorites like Mutation Mode and Shadow Mode. All of them are played in one of more than twenty well-designed levels.</p>
<p>Before you start playing, you have the chance to personalize your character's appearance and weapons. There are all kinds of upgrades available for the over twenty different weapons in the game, including pistols, lightweight machine guns, shotguns, rifles, and many more.At the end of each game in CrossFire, you are awarded with experience and other rewards according to how well you played. This is how you gain levels and can buy upgrades for your in-game avatar. Of course, you also have the option to invest real money to buy upgrades.CrossFire is a massive multiplayer first-person shooting game, and it's no accident that over 400 million users have already signed up. It's an outstanding game for its genres, with tons of possibilities for anyone who wants to shoot off a few rounds.A crossfire (also known as interlocking fire) is a military term for the siting of weapons (often automatic weapons such as assault rifles or sub-machine guns) so that their arcs of fire overlap. This tactic came to prominence in World War I.</p>
<p>Siting weapons this way is an example of the application of the defensive principle of mutual support. The advantage of siting weapons that mutually support one another is that it is difficult for an attacker to find a covered approach to any one defensive position. Use of armour, air support, indirect fire support, and stealth are tactics that may be used to assault a defensive position. However, when combined with land mines, snipers, barbed wire, and air cover, crossfire became a difficult tactic to counter in the early 20th century.</p>
<p>To be "caught in the crossfire" is an expression that often refers to unintended casualties (bystanders, etc.) who were killed or wounded by being exposed to the gunfire of a battle or gun fight, such as in a position to be hit by bullets of either side. The phrase has come to mean any injury, damage or harm (physical or otherwise) caused to a third party due to the action of belligerents </p></b>
