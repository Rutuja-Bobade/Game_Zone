<p>Battle Royale mode lets a maximum of 52 players land on a random island without weapons. All of them have to survive by eliminating each other using weapons and accessories that are found in the buildings. Players have the option to play this mode solo, or in a team of 2 or 4 players. If players play this mode ranked, it will have an impact on their rank. Whereas Classic mode is just for fun and practice. There are six Battle Royale maps in Free Fire they are Bermuda, Bermuda Remastered, Kalahari, Purgatory, Alpine, and NeXTerra.</p>
<p>Clash Squad is a 4 VS 4 mode. In this mode, players use in-game money to buy weapons and other items from a shop during preparation time, and then fight against the opponent team. As a best-of-7 mode, games last from four to seven rounds. A round is won when all 4 players of one team are eliminated, either by the other team or by environmental damage. As of 2022 the game uses the same maps as the Battle Royale mode. Clash Squad can be played both as Ranked and Classic.</p>
